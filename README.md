# KickFFT
A library for implementing a discrete Fourier transform on an input data array. This library uses lookup tables for the
trigonometric functions to reduce processing power and increase code efficiency.
Specifically written for Arduino, but can be ported to other microcontrollers.


Partially used in Linnes Lab's Kick LL smartwatch, a research device for measuring heart rate, respiration, and blood oxygen.
Originally designed for monitoring substance abuse disorder patients in out-patient settings for ambulatory purposes.

Open-sourcing this bit of code allows us to give back to the community in hopes that it will aide in someone else's development.
